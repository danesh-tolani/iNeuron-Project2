# Project 2

Hi, My name is **Danesh Tolani** and I have completed the 2nd Project of the iNeuron Full Stack Course.

The most challenging things were:

- Adding layer over the image.
- Aligning the background as per the aspect ratio without the image distorting.

It took me **2 Hours** to complete this project
